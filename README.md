## Lab Overview

For this lab we were tasked to construct a working website based on the website chosen for our previous lab, where we had to create
high fidelity prototypes for our website designs on figma.

I decided to choose EduRec as it was an important administrative website for all NUS students. 
Despite its importance, for some reason the website was poorly designed and buggy. 

### Constraints

I did not use any static site generator to create these pages due to time constraints. 

We were not allowed to use any additional runtime environments, JS libraries or pre-processors such as node or react, except for jQuery.
